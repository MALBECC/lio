FDF Standard. Version 0.6.5, September 1998

Input lines are parsed and a token list is created. A token is:

	* Any number of characters enclosed in a matching pair 
	  of quotes (",',`). Embedded strings are not considered tokens.
	  The quotes are removed by the parsing routine.

	* A string of characters from the set [A-Z,a-z,0-9] of
	  alphanumeric characters plus $%&@_.-*/^+~ (and any adjacent
          unmatched quotes, as in apostrophes)

	* The character '<' by itself.

Examples:
	
MeshCutoff <"File.fdf"		3 tokens: MeshCutoff, <, File.fdf
System_Name  Devil's staircase   3 tokens: System_Name, Devil's, staircase
%block Coordinates,AtomicCoordinates %dump < coords.dat  6 tokens

The characters '#', ';', and '!' signal the beginning of a comment. Any
remaining characters on the line are discarded.

Labels and directives (%block, %include, %endblock) are case-insensitive.
Labels are also punctuation-insensitive, by which it is understood that
the characters '.', '_', and '-' are removed before any comparison is made.


Label   [  Value ]

	This line assigns an optional Value to Label. Value could be
	a token or a sequence of tokens not including '<'. 
	'Numerical' routines such as fdf_integer will only use the first 
	token, but fdf_string will return the whole list. 

%block Label

# Optional comments
%endblock [ Label ]

	This construct specifies a block of data that is to be read
	by the calling program after a call to fdf_block. The contents
	of the block are dumped to fdf_out. %block and %endblock must
	be the first tokens in their respective lines.

%block Label  < Filename  [ %dump ]

	Opens Filename in order to read the block. If %dump appears
	anywhere (except as the first token), the contents of Filename
	are dumped to fdf_out.

%include  Filename  # Comments

	Opens Filename and continues reading from it.

Label   < Filename   # Comments

	Opens Filename and continues reading from it, ONLY if searching
	for Label.

	There is a maximum number of files that can be opened at the
	same time for fdf processing.
