The FDF package, by Alberto Garcia and Jose Soler, is still at a
relatively early stage of development. At this time we are making it
available to selected parties for evaluation and suggestions for improvement. 

We request that the copyright notices in the code be kept if the package is
eventually used as part of another program.
