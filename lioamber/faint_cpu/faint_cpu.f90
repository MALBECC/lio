!% MODULE FAINT_CPU %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%!
! This modules contain all the CPU KS analytic integrals (i.e., all non-XC     !
! integrals) and calculations for the density fitting sets, using the          !
! Obara-Saika recursive method.                                                !
! Edit at your own risk, it took two months to properly reformat this. Think   !
! twice about wasting your time here unless it is strictly necessary.          !
!                                                                              !
! Original integrals: Dario Estrin, 1992                                       !
! Original module:    Francisco Ramirez, Oct/2017                              !
! First refactor:     Diego Armi√±o, May/2018                                   !
! Full refactor:      Federico Pedron, Sep/2018                                !
! Included ECP:       Nicolas Foglia, Nov/2019                                 !
