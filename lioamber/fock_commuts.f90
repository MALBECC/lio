! This file contains calc_fock_commuts, which calculates F' and [F',P'] for    !
! DIIS matrices fockm and FP_PFm.                                              !
! Input: F (fock), P (rho), X, Y                                               !
! F' = X^T * F * X   |   P' = Y^T * P * Y   | X = (Y^-1)^T                     !
! => [F',P'] = X^T * F * P * Y - Y^T * P * F * X = A - A^T                     !
! Where A = X^T * F * P * Y                                                    !
! Output: A (scratch), A^T (scratch1), F' (fock)                               !
