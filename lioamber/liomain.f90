!%% LIOMAIN.F90  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%!
! This file contains the liomain subroutine, which performs several common     !
! procedures before and after calling SCF either by LIO alone or when          !
! performing in tantem with AMBER/GROMACS. Currently the routine:              !
! * Allocates matrices needed for SCF calculations.                            !
! * Calls SCF or SCFOP for closed/open shell calculations.                     !
! Other interfacial routines included are:                                     !
! * do_forces        (calculates forces/gradients)                             !
! * do_dipole        (calculates dipole moment)                                !
! * do_population_analysis (performs the analysis required)                    !
! * do_fukui         (performs Fukui function calculation and printing)        !
