subroutine find_free_unit( free_unit, last_unit, return_stat )
!
!     This subroutine automatizes the process of finding a free available
!  unit to open a file into. It receives three arguments:
!
!  free_unit (inout):
!     On input, it contains the first unit that the subroutine will try.
!     On output, it contains the last unit that the subroutine has tried
!     (if no error occurrs, that last unit is one that is free and available
!     to use). This subroutine will never use a unit lower that 10 (in which
!     case, it ignores this argument).
!
!  last_unit (in):
!     The last unit the subroutine will try out.
!
!  resturn_stat (optional out):
!     Contains information about any error that might have occurred during
!     this procedure. If nothing went wrongh, it returns 0. If it is not
!     present, any error will halt the program.
